# RocketLaunch
Rocket Launch App in Development.
Challenges Completed: 1. User-friendly, native feeling, and actually works 2. Pull data from an online source, convert to JSON format (fieldbook), take the data and display it for the user in the app. 3. Countdown timer, displays message when launched. 4. When clicked on, information about launch is displayed

Further Work: 1. Get the app on the apple app store or google play store. 2. Find way to use "scraper" to automatically transfer data from a launch website onto fieldbook spreadsheet. 3. (Small task) Change datetime format on the launch page to be easier to read. 

Recently Completed:
8.10.16 Removed a few annoying images (previously added ASPIRE, APL images in, along with "Created by Sam Chan + Mentor Chris Krupiarz")
8.10.16 Added more launches to Fieldbook launches, for a total of 9, up to around 43 days out.
